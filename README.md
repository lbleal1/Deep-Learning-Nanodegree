# Deep Learning Nanodegree

After the 3.5 months spent for Phase 1 which is a Challenge Course for the AI Track, the most awaited announcements of candidates continuing to phase 2 has arrived. This is a huge thanks to Udacity and Bertelsmann for giving me another opportunity to continue learning AI, specifically Deep Learning.

Along with the announcements of scholarships came our awards from Phase 1 via Palak Sidani of Udacity.

To keep track and to practice the daily habit of impproving my skils, I would be using this along with other things to do the #100DaysOfCode challenge in twitter. See here: https://twitter.com/lbleal1
