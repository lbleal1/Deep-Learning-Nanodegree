# Deep Learning Nanodegree

After the 3.5 months spent for Phase 1 which is a Challenge Course for the AI Track, the most awaited announcements of candidates continuing to phase 2 has arrived. This is a huge thanks to Udacity and Bertelsmann for giving me another opportunity to continue learning AI, specifically Deep Learning.
